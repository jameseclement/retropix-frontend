RetroPix is a Pix-Map Graphics Editor designed for Children, and inspired by the program Kidpix, which gave me and many other children hours of entertainment in the 90s. 

My partner and I designed RetroPix using the React.js Frontend in this Repo, and a Ruby-on-Rails/PostgreSQL Backend and Database which can be found at https://github.com/jameseclement/retropix-backend
